Script to back up data from Bruker NMR spectrometers to a network drive for easy access for users.
Also generates a log of the experiments with basic information, which can, in principle, be used for billing purposes or for troubleshooting (i.e. figuring out what sample was last in the machine before a problem occurred).
The copying is done using the robocopy program, but rsync could just as easily used. In either case, due to the large number of small files generated by NMR experiments, just passing the data directory paths to the copying program will lead to very long execution times (up to several hours depending on the amount of data), as the copying program must checked the modification date of each individual file passed to it. As such, filtering the data folders by modification date before passing the paths to the copying program is a necessity if the program has to run repeatedly every few minutes. 
If the data volume is smaller or the use-case is such that the back-up script only needs to run once per day, the filtering can be removed.
